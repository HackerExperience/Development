# Development Team Statement

As a team, our main motivation is to set forth the project's vision of getting people involved on Open Source Software as first-time contributors, which is one way to achieve the project's main objective of fostering Computer Science education.

We know contributing with code is hard, specially for newcomers. Our mission is to lower the barrier for external code contributions, making it possible and enjoyable.

## Goals

- Summarize development status of major software repositories (Helix, HELF and HEBorn for now).
- Provide a clear way for potential contributors to pick specific tasks based on type, difficulty and programming language. 

## Plan

Note: We are still figuring this out. Do send suggestions if you've got any.
