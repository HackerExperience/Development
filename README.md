# Hacker Experience Development Team

Welcome to the home of the Development team, responsible for overseeing and managing development of Hacker Experience 1 & 2.

## Goals

- Summarize development status of major software repositories ([Helix](https://github.com/hackerexperience/helix), [HELF](https://github.com/hackerexperience/helf) and [HEBorn](https://github.com/hackerexperience/heborn) for now).
- Provide a clear way for potential contributors to pick specific tasks based on type, difficulty and programming language.
